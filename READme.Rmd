**1. CodeBook.md**: description of the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to clean up the data  
**2. README.md**: this file  
**3. run_analysis.R**: R script to transform raw data set in a tidy one  

### How to create the tidy data set  

1. Open a R console and set the working directory   
2. source run_analisys.R script:
